/*
Dry Run with s1 = "ab" and s2 = "eidboaoo":

Initialize s1 = "ab" and s2 = "eidboaoo".
Initialize arrays count1 and count2 with 26 zeros each to represent the character counts.
cpp
Copy code
count1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]
count2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]
Loop through s1 to count the frequency of each character in count1:

For the first character 'a':

index1 = 0 (because 'a' - 'a' = 0)
Increment count1[0] by 1, so count1 = [1, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0]
For the second character 'b':

index1 = 1 (because 'b' - 'a' = 1)
Increment count1[1] by 1, so count1 = [1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]
Initialize i = 0 and len1 = 2 (length of s1).

Start looping through s2 from i = 0 to i = 1 (first window):

For the character 'e':
index2 = 4 (because 'e' - 'a' = 4)
Increment count2[4] by 1, so count2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue to the next character.

Increment i to 2.

Continue looping through s2:

For the character 'i':
index2 = 8 (because 'i' - 'a' = 8)
Increment count2[8] by 1, so count2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ..., 1]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue to the next character.

Increment i to 3.

Continue looping through s2:

For the character 'd':
index2 = 3 (because 'd' - 'a' = 3)
Increment count2[3] by 1, so count2 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, ..., 1]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue to the next character.

Increment i to 4.

Continue looping through s2:

For the character 'b':
index2 = 1 (because 'b' - 'a' = 1)
Increment count2[1] by 1, so count2 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ..., 1]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue to the next character.

Increment i to 5.

Continue looping through s2:

For the character 'o':
index2 = 14 (because 'o' - 'a' = 14)
Increment count2[14] by 1, so count2 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ..., 2]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue to the next character.

Increment i to 6.

Continue looping through s2:

For the character 'a':
index2 = 0 (because 'a' - 'a' = 0)
Increment count2[0] by 1, so count2 = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ..., 2]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue to the next character.

Increment i to 7.

Continue looping through s2:

For the character 'o':
index2 = 14 (because 'o' - 'a' = 14)
Increment count2[14] by 1, so count2 = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ..., 3]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue to the next character.

Increment i to 8.

The first window of characters in s2 has been checked, and it does not contain a permutation of s1.

Start sliding the window:

For the character 'e':
index_new = 4 (because 'e' - 'a' = 4)
Increment count2[4] by 1, so count2 = [1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, ..., 3]
index_old = 0 (because the character at i - len1 = 8 - 2 = 6 is 'a')
Decrement count2[0] by 1, so count2 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, ..., 3]
Check if count1 and count2 are equal (they are not equal), so continue sliding the window.

Continue sliding the window through s2, but it still does not contain a permutation of s1.

The entire string s2 has been checked, and no permutation of s1 is found.

Return false because no permutation of s1 is present in s2.

Final Output:

A permutation of the first string is not present in the second string.

In this dry run, we've gone through the code step by step to check if a permutation of s1 is present in s2. In this particular case, there was no permutation found.
